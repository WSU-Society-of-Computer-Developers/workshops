# Building Interactive Web Pages: JavaScript DOM Essentials

JavaScript DOM scripting is an essential skill for front-end developers who want to create dynamic and interactive web pages. The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents the structure of an HTML or XML document as a tree-like structure of nodes and objects. With JavaScript, developers can access and manipulate the content and structure of the DOM to create dynamic user interfaces, handle events, and perform various other tasks. In this workshop, we will cover the fundamentals of JavaScript DOM scripting, including how to access, manipulate, and traverse the DOM using JavaScript.
