# Mobile App Development Workshop

Build your first cross-platform mobile application with [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) and [Expo](https://expo.dev).

This workshop will largely follow the contents from the expo dev [guide](https://docs.expo.dev/tutorial/create-your-first-app/).

# Prereqs

- Code editor of your choice

To get started, run:

```
npx create-expo-app@latest MyApp
cd MyApp

# run this to get a clean project
npm run reset-project
```
